# Hot Prospects

Hot Prospects is an app designed to help users track who they meet at conferences. It enables users to share their attendee information using a QR code and allows others to scan the code to add potential leads for future follow-up. 

## Features

- **Making Selection Lists**: Build selection lists using SwiftUI for better user interaction.
- **TabView**: Implement a multi-tab interface to navigate between different sections of the app.
- **Swift Result Type**: Explore a deep dive into Swift's `Result` type for handling success and failure cases.
- **Image Interpolation**: Use Core Image for generating and interpolating images, like QR codes.
- **Context Menus**: Add context menus for more interaction options, letting users perform actions on specific items.
- **Custom Row Swipe Actions**: Enhance list items with swipe actions using `swipeActions{}` for efficient item management.
- **Local Notifications**: Schedule and display local notifications, ensuring users donâ€™t miss important follow-ups.
- **QR Code Generation & Scanning**: Utilize Core Image to generate QR codes for attendee information and scan codes to add leads.
- **Swift Package Manager**: Manage external dependencies using Swift Package Manager to easily integrate third-party packages.
